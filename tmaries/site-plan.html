        At T. Marie's, we strive for the most natural ingredients.  If you can't spell it, we don't use it.  Just like our ingredients, we want our consumers to be able to have the most simple and enjoyable process while ordering their sweet treats.  We hope our consumers can have a pleasant shopping experience in our stores and online platforms.  We want T. Marie's to be your first stop when you need a treat.  Not only can you put an order online, but we also have several locations where you can stop and make your orders.  We can also have your orders delivered to your local T. Marie's store.

      <h3>Order Sweet Treats</h3>
      <p>
        To fulfill an order, the customers can order online, or they can call one of our super sweet representatives.  If changes need to be made to your order, please contact customer service as soon as possible to avoid extra charges or delays in your order.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our most frequent questions has been how fast is our shipping process.  We take our shipping process very seriously.  We want our customers to have the best-tasting treats.  Orders are set to arrive on time and are typically shipped 1-3 days before your selected date.  You will receive a tracking email when the item/items have shipped.  Sometimes you may receive an email letting us know that we are making your cake and we are about to send it out for advance notice.  All our products will be packaged in special containers to keep your items cool.  We will ensure your treats are safe during the delivery process and guarantee freshness upon delivery.  All of our treats will come ready to eat.  We only recommend you keep our treats for 4-5 days.  After that, the items should be thrown out or put in the freezer by day the second day to preserve shelf life.  If you ever need any help with an online delivery, please contact us by email: TMaries@sweettreats.com or you can call us Monday through Friday MST at 1-800-TMARIES(687-4377)
      </p>
      <p>
      <li>	If your order has already been processed, we will do our best to accommodate you, but if your shipping label has been made, we cannot change your order.
      <li>	There will be no cancellation or refunds after the shipping label has been created and the order has been processed.
      <li>	If it is a large order, we will process half the fee upfront, and when it's completed, we will charge the remaining balance.</li>
      </p>
      <p>Due to circumstances outside of T. Marie’s control like weather storms and COVID in the shipping network, we strongly suggest scheduling your gifts to be delivered 1-2 days before your celebration. Our treats and packaging can withstand the multiple days of shipping and stays fresh at room temperature for five days after delivery.
