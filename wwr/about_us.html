                        <li class="safty-list">Always wear your life jacket while on the river. The life jacket should fit snugly. Do
                            always check with your guide before you remove your life jacket even on a calm section.</li>
                        <li class="safty-list">Helmets are more to protect you from the paddles of your enthusiastic rafting companions, and the oars/frame on a raft (in case of a flip on an oar rig), and very rarely as protection against the rocks on a river.</li>
                        <li class="safty-list">Even if you go only to look at a rapid, keep your life jacket and helmet on. It is all too easy to slip into the rapid. Even if you fall while scrambling on the rocks above the rapid, your safety gear will protect you.</li>   
                        <li class="safty-list">In case the raft is about to hit a boulder, do not try and stop the two-ton momentum of the raft with your lightweight paddle, foot or hands â€“ you are likely to get hurt. Let the raft bounce off the rocks</li>
                        <li class="safty-list">If you fall off the boat, please remeber to relax! HOLD ON TO PADDLE, SWIM IN THE DIRECTION YOUR GUIDE POINTS YOU IN.</li>
                        <li class="safty-list">Have a good time and have fun. Enjoy the nature around you.</li>

                <section class="about-msg">
                    <p>Our team of fun, passionate, professional guides is led by a top-notch management team. Our
                        guides are seasoned guides with rafting experience and know the rivers and areas very well.
                        Several of our trip leaders have been around for decades! For example, our Director of
                        Operations, Ken Haybottom, has been with us for 37 years. His second-in-command at Dry Oar, Tina
                        Flanknuhm, has been with us for 32 years. This expertise is essential to how Dry Oar maintains
                        our unique and professional operations. Every step of the way, we want to keep our guests safe
                        and to be able to give everyone the best tours in the West.</p>
