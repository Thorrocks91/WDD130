                    <h2>Come Relax and Explore</h2>
                    <p>Dry Oar, we believe there should be nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we
                        subscribe to the philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means looking around and
                        noticing the nature surrounding the rivers we love. If you want a mellower trip book one of our
                        level one trips or our scenic tours.</p>

                    <h2>Have a Wild Ride</h2>
                    <p>Ready to get your adrenaline pumping! We believe that the intense feeling you get
                        when looking down a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm, beautiful water that
                        follows even more. Book one of our more intense tours if you are ready for a wild ride. These
                        tours range from levels 2 to 4. Level 2 is mild dips and fast-moving water, all the way up to
                        level 4, where you get into rapids, fast-moving water, and medium water dips. We make some level
                        5 trips, but very few due to the dangers and risks of the class. If you would like to book a
                        level 5 tour, please call us. We also ask if you want to do a level 5 tour to have at least a
                        minimum of level 4 classification</p>
